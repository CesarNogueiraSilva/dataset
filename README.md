Learn how to train a 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN) to predict presence of pneumonia. Now on the Keras docs ([Link](https://keras.io/examples/vision/3D_image_classification/))!

## Dataset

The dataset used in this tutorial is by [MosMedData: Chest CT Scans with COVID-19 Related Findings](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.20.20100362v1) which consists of 200 3D CT scans in total for the two classes. More detail [here](https://github.com/hasibzunair/3D-image-classification-tutorial/releases/tag/v0.2). Note that the data is public and I've kept it here for easy access/usage.

## What is it about?

This tutorial will show the steps needed to build a 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN) to predict the presence of viral pneumonia in computer tomography (CT) scans. 2D CNNs are commonly used to process RGB images (3 channels). A 3D CNN is simply the 3D equivalent: it takes as input a 3D volume or a sequence of 2D frames (e.g. slices in a CT scan), 3D CNNs are a powerful model for learning representations for volumetric data.
